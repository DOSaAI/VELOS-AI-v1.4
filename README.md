# **VELOS AI v1.4** - Intelligent Chatbot with Dynamic AI Responses 🌐🤖  

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.4-blue)](https://github.com/DOSaAI/VELOS-AI-v1.-4)  
🚀 **Web-Based AI Chatbot** | ⚡ **Node.js Backend** | 🔥 **Dynamic AI Word Prediction**  

---

## **📌 About VELOS AI v1.4**
VELOS AI v1.4 is an **advanced AI chatbot** built with **Node.js, Express, and a JSON-based Q&A system**. Unlike traditional chatbots, this version **does not return predefined answers**. Instead, it:
1. **Searches for similar questions** in its dataset.
2. **Collects multiple possible answers**.
3. **Predicts the response dynamically** by generating words one after another, like a **Markov model**.

### ⚠️ **Important: VELOS AI Does Not Remember Past Conversations**
- VELOS AI **does not track chat history** or remember previous messages.
- Each response is **generated independently**, based only on the latest user input.
- Conversations **do not have context or memory**, so it won’t recall past interactions.

This makes VELOS AI **fast, lightweight, and private**, but **not suitable for long, contextual conversations**.

---

## **🚀 Features**
✅ **Web-Based Chat Interface** – A clean, simple UI for easy interaction.  
✅ **Node.js Backend** – Uses Express to process AI responses.  
✅ **Markov-Like AI Model** – Dynamically generates unique responses.  
✅ **Optimized for Termux** – Runs efficiently on mobile devices.  
✅ **Easy Customization** – Modify Q&A responses via `qa.json`.  
✅ **No Memory** – Ensures privacy but lacks conversation context.  

---

## **📦 Installation**
### **1️⃣ Install Node.js**
For **Termux/Linux/macOS**:
```bash
pkg install nodejs -y
```
For **Windows**:  
[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

---

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DOSaAI/VELOS-AI-v1.4.git
cd VELOS-AI-v1.4
```

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

---

### **4️⃣ Run the Server**
```bash
node server.js
```

---

### **5️⃣ Open the Chat**
- **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.  
- Start chatting with **VELOS AI**! 💬  

---

## **📖 How VELOS AI Works**
1. **User asks a question** via the web chat.  
2. **Server searches for similar questions** in `qa.json`.  
3. **AI collects all relevant answers** from the dataset.  
4. **AI predicts the response dynamically** by choosing words from multiple answers.  
5. **A unique, natural-sounding reply** is generated.  

### ⚠️ **Reminder: No Conversation Memory**
Each message is processed **individually** – the chatbot **does not remember** what was said earlier in the conversation.

## **🛠️ Customizing the AI**
Want to add more responses? Just **edit `qa.json`**:
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is AI?",
    "answer": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, enabling machines to learn and make decisions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who created you?",
    "answer": "I was developed as an open-source AI assistant using Node.js."
  }
]
```
- **Add new Q&A pairs** to improve AI responses.  
- **Save & restart the server** to apply changes.
